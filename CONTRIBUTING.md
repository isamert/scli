# Contributing

Thank you for helping make `scli` better! (And for actually reading the guidelines)

## Issues

- Check logs. When reporting a problem, check if there is a relevant output in the log file (see `--log-file` and `--debug` in `--help`).
	At a minimum, it will tell you the versions of scli and dependencies used.
	⚠ Logs might contain personal information. Make sure to remove anything you don't want published on the internet.

## Pull Requests

- Use `develop` branch as the base for new branches, as well as the 'merge to' branch when creating a new pull request.
- Test with the latest release of `signal-cli` (if relevant to code changes).
